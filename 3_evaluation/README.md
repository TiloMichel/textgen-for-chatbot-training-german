# Evaluation
This folder contains all evaluation scripts used.

The script `multiple_model_evaluation.ipynb` contains the code with which the trained models were evaluated. The script `translation_pipeline_evaluation.ipynb` contains the code for the translation pipeline evaluation. The implementation and configuration of the metrics is the same in both notebooks.
