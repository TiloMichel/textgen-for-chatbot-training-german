# Question generation
Two approaches were tested for question generation. On the one hand the question generation without knowledge of the answer (**answer-agnostic**) and on the other hand the question generation with knowledge of the answer (**answer-aware**).

The folders in this directory contain the evaluations for each question generation type.
